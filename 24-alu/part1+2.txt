Solved by hand

The MONAD program repeats the same sequence of instructions fourteen times.
Very roughly:

	(1) Get a digit (1-9) and store it in w.
	(2) If w = z%26 + some number, do nothing.
	(3) Otherwise, z = z*26 + some other number.

Seven of the fourteen times this is done, z is also divided by 26 at some point, forcing it towards zero.
Also, seven of fourteen times, the condition in step (2) cannot be satisfied for any value of 1 <= w <= 9, causing z to grow.
We need to choose values of w so that the condition in (2) is satisfied every time possible.
Tracing through the code, we can also determine that "some number" in step (2) is an expression involving exactly one previously encountered input digit.

Label the fourteen input digits ABCDEFGHIJKLMN.
We end up with 7 easy equations relating pairs of digits, e.g.

	D = C + 2
	...
	N = A - 4

Choosing values of AB..N so that one in each related pair is a 9 gives the maximum valid serial number.
For part 2, choose AB..N so that each pair has a 1.
